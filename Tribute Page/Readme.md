            <h2>Here's some interesting information about Plato's life:</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="list">
            <ul>
              <li>Plato was born around <span>428 B.C.<span></li>
              <li>He was educated in philosophy, poetry and gymnastics by distinguished Athenian teachers including the philosopher <a href="">Cratylus</a></li>
              <li>The young Plato became a devoted follower of <a href="">Socrates</a> — indeed, he was one of the youths Socrates was condemned for allegedly corrupting</li>
              <li>Following Socrates’ forced suicide, Plato spent 12 years traveling in southern Italy, Sicily and Egypt, studying with other philosophers including followers of the mystic mathematician Pythagoras</li>
              <li>Plato’s time among the Pythagoreans piqued his interest in mathematics</li>
              <li>Plato’s Theory of Forms, stating that the physical world we know is but a shadow of the real one, was strongly influenced by Parmenides and Zeno of Elea</li>
              <li>Plato had a lifelong relationship with the ruling family of Syracuse, who would later seek his advice on reforming their city’s politics</li>
              <li>Around 387, the 40-year-old Plato returned to Athens and founded his philosophical school in the grove of the Greek hero Academus, just outside the city walls</li>
              <li>Aristotle arrived from northern Greece to join the Academy at age 17, studying and teaching there for the last 20 years of Plato’s life</li>
              <li>All of Plato’s surviving writings are in dialogue form, with the character of Socrates appearing in all but one of them</li>
              <li>His 36 dialogues are generally ordered into early, middle and late, though their chronology is determined by style and content rather than specific dates</li>
              <li>In the “Euthpyro,” Socrates’ endless questioning pushes a religious expert to realize that he has no understanding of what “piety” means</li>
              <li>The “Symposium” is a series of drinking-party speeches on the nature of love, in which Socrates says the best thing to do with romantic desire is to convert it into amicable truth-seeking</li>
              <li>The monumental “Republic” is a parallel exploration of the soul of a nation and of an individual. In both, Plato finds a three-part hierarchy between rulers, auxiliaries and citizens and between reason, emotion and desire</li>
              <li>According to Plato, just as reason should reign supreme in the individual, so should a wise ruler control a society</li>
              <li>Plato died in Athens, and was probably buried on the Academy grounds</li>
            </ul>

            <p>“Human behavior flows from three main sources: desire, emotion and knowledge.”</p>
